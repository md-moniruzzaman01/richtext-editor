## 🚀 Why I Built This

Most editors are either too heavy, too limited, or too complex to style.  
This project gives you **full control** over the UI, behavior, and output — perfect for personal projects or lightweight web apps.

## 📦 Installation / Usage

```html
<div id="editor"></div>

<script src="/your-editor.js"></script>
<script>
  const editor = new MyRichTextEditor('#editor', {
    placeholder: 'Start typing...',
  });
</script>

```


## 📄 Output

This editor provides clean, developer-friendly output with zero clutter:

- **Clean HTML** — formatted content without unnecessary inline styles  
- **Optional JSON Output** — structure your content for custom rendering
